# NYC_Taxi_Fare_Prediction
📌 NYC Taxi Fare Prediction - A data-driven project that builds a regression model to estimate taxi fares in New York City using historical trip data. The project involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building, and visualization to improve fare transparency for riders.
## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to develop a regression model that predicts taxi fares in New York City before a ride. Using historical trip data provided by the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC), we analyze key fare factors, build a predictive model, and deploy it for real-world usage.

## 🎯 Project Goals
- Clean and preprocess NYC taxi trip data.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand fare determinants.
- Develop a regression model to estimate taxi fares.
- Implement A/B testing to optimize model performance.
- Visualize findings and present results.

4. **Open and execute notebooks** in the `Notebooks/` folder.

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
We analyze key factors affecting taxi fares, such as:
- Trip distance
- Time of day
- Passenger count
- Weather conditions

## 📈 Model Development
- Implemented regression models: Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.
- Conducted A/B testing to optimize performance.
- Evaluated model accuracy using RMSE and R² scores.

## 📢 Results & Insights
- The final model predicts fares with an **accuracy of XX%**.
- **Distance and time of day** are the most significant predictors.
- The predictive model can be integrated into a user-friendly app for fare estimation.
